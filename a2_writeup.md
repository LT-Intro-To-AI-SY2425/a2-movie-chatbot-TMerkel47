# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
I found it kinda difficult to learn and adjust to Python and it's different way of working. It wasn't super different but some things were and it just threw me off a bit at first.


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
If you have a database of movies and information on those movies, you can use the match function to find movies that fall under certain constraints that you provide.
